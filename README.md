# Stock Market Prediction using Linear Regression and LSTM

This project implements stock market prediction using two approaches:
You will find a powerpoint and a paper written in Turkish for the project.

1. **Linear Regression**: A statistical method for predicting the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
2. **LSTM-based RNN**: A deep learning approach leveraging Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture temporal dependencies in stock data.

## Features
- Predict stock prices using historical data.
- Compare prediction accuracy of Linear Regression and LSTM models.
- Analyze and visualize prediction results for Apple stock data.

## Data
The dataset is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API and cleaned for training and testing.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed, along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `yfinance`
